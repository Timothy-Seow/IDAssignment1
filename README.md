Project's Name: 
ID Assignment 1 - Mist Website

Overview :
The website i am making is a game review website that allow users to the webpage to find a game and look upon its reviews and ratings based on gameplay, storyline (if game has a story), visual graphics, objective of the game and experience of people who has played it.

The main purpose is to allow users to find out how good a game is, whether it suits the user or not. It helps to prevent users from buying games that they don't like with the reason being that they didn't like the game after playing it.

Design Process: 
The target audience of this website is people who play games, which we mostly refer them to as "gamers" or "players". With the advancing technology of graphic design, the game visuals, especially the environment and character are what most players nowadays focus on. More and more games that costs money are appearing on the market due to better graphics and content. Which is why the content and design of the game, its cross-platform compatibility and whether it is multiplayer becomes very important. Almost half of the players worldwide would want to play a game where they can interact with other real life players within the game. With this feature, they are also allowed to play with their friends online at the comfort of their homes. So, they would want to know whether the game suits their preferences before buying the game, especially if the game is not free.

With this website, they can know what the game is about,the story of the game, the objectives of the game, whether its singleplayer or multiplayer and how other players feel about this game, etc, before getting the game for themselves. Most importantly, this website provides free reviews and ratings, so nobody is being restricted from the content.

User Stories:

As a player, I want to get a game for my friend that rarely plays games, so I need to find what suits him/her the most before getting it.
